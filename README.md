# Linear-Regression-on-synthetic-data
This assignment shows how we can extend ordinary least squares regression, which uses the hypothesis class of linear regression functions, to non-linear regression functions modeled using polynomial basis functions and radial basis functions. The function we want to fit is a univariate function as it has only one input variable.
